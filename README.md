Loop server
===========

This is the server part of the loop project.

It exposes the following APIs:

    # A "*" means this URI requires authentication (you should pass a valid
    # BrowserID assertion).

    * POST /registration/  →  Associates a Simple Push Endpoint (URL)
                              with the authenticated user.
                              (Requires a "simple_push_url" parameter.)

    * POST /call-url/      →  Create the call url a callee can click on.
                              (Requires "remote_id" and "valid_duration"
                              parameters).

      GET  /calls/{token}  →  Get the app (that's the url in question, which
                              displays an app)
                              (No parameter required.)

      POST /calls/{token}  →  Add an incoming call (does a simple push notif
                              and gets room tokens), return participant tokens.
                              (Requires "nickname" parameter)

    * GET  /calls/         →  List incoming calls for the authenticated user.
                              (Requires a "version" parameter).
